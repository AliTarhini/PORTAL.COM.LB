<br>
The <strong>PORTAL.COM.LB</strong> project is a <strong>Digital Portal</strong> for the government services of the REPUBLIC OF LEBANON.
<br>
This is <strong>NOT an official app of the government</strong>. Its an app developed by me and hopefully will be adopted by the government of the REPUBLIC OF LEBANON in the future after we introduce it to them. Its a Digital Portal where people can conclude their legal activities online without the need for a physical presence at government offices.
The idea behind <strong>PORTAL.COM.LB</strong> is to have 2 apps (APKs) on the website always up-to-date. One app for the citizens and the other one for government officials.
<br>
<br>
'Till now I have designed a Digital ID and its' future functionality, if its to be linked to a database in the future.
Please note that the Arabic Support in the app works on runtime.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>My future plans contain but are not limited to;</strong>
<br>
<br>
Encrypting all data displayed on the Digital ID with RSA-2048 and;
  1. Make a QR code out of the data encrypted with the public key.
  2. Save the encrypted data to the device's NFC chip.
<br>
The Government app will have;
  1. NFC readability and QR code readibility. Government officials will choose the verification type.
  2. Access to private key (whether it's implemented inside the app or being received by a server) and decrypt the read public key and turn it back into data.
<br>
<br>
The PORTAL has balance (as in monetary balance) used to pay your taxes, as you're supposed to pay certain fees and taxes for government services in LEBANON.
<br>
As for now, the balance is used to get an extract of your Registry Record, It's a PRINT button in the bottom-middle of the PORTAL app, each print will cost 1 USD.
<br>
The printed registry extract record should have the date of print on it. As it shouldn't be older than 3 months for the extract record to be accepted at government offices.
